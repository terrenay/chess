There were two bugs in minimax that prevented checkmate control from working properly. 

1) Black and White were swapped when making sure that it was check given that 0 legal moves were
found. For that reason, the program sometimes classified checkmates as stalemates and did not 
play moves leading to that position.

2) When one side can force checkmate, the other side still has to play SOME move (even though
all of them have the worst possible dynamic evaluation). For that reason, the first move minimax
finds is set as a default move. Unfortunately, I set the first OVERALL move as a default instead
of the first LEGAL move. That's why, once black had found a forced checkmate, the engine played 
rook a1 to b1 (first move in generate()), even though this left the king in check.
